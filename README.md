# Oreo

A fun, exploratory project aimed at learning and experimenting with Discord.js. It includes a .NET WinForms manager for monitoring and managing the botâ€™s operations. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage details for anyone interested in it. This project may contain some unfound bugs :P

## Prerequisites

- Preferrably Windows OS to host the bot (for UI)
- Node.js (version 14 or later)

## Installation

1. Ensure Node.js is installed. You can check with `node -v` or `npm -v`
2. Create a new file, named `secrets.js`, using the following template:
    ```
    export const botToken = '' // Your bot's token here
    export const botID = '' // Your bot's ID here
    export const youtubeCookies = [] // (Optional) Your Youtube account's cookies
    ```
3. Put this file in *"oreo_app/src/"*

    ### For Windows
    4. Run the executable in *"oreo_manager/"*
    5. Press the "Install" button to install dependencies.
    
    ### For Linux - Ubuntu/Debian
    4. Run the following commands to set up Node.js (if not done so):
        ```
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install nodejs npm
        node -v && npm -v
        ```
        
    5. Install pm2 to manage the bot:
        ```
        sudo npm install pm2 -g
        pm2 -v (To ensure it is installed properly)
        ```
